# Mandelbrot Set 

### What is Mandelbrot set?

The Mandelbrot Set is known to be one of the most beautiful fractals in mathematics. We can use computers to create detailed renderings of the infinitely self similar image.

The formal defintition of the Mandelbrot Set is the _"set of values of c in the complex plane for which the orbit of 0 under iteration of the quadratic map remains boundedâ€¦"_

### What does this mean?
Basically, take a complex number a + bi, square it, then add itself. Now take the solution, square it, then add the original number. As you repeat this process, the solution may approach infinity (diverge). On the other hand, the solution after continual iteration may stay bounded to finite numbers.

The dark regions inside the bounded region of the Mandelbrot Set are the complex numbers that when iterated over by the function, stay bounded. Where the Mandelbrot set gets really interesting is understanding the behavior near these points by visualizing at what rate the function diverges.
